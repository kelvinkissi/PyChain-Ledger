# Overview

In this repository I used [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the web interface in order to build a blockchain-based ledger system.

This ledger should enable individuals to perform financial transactions, such as transferring money between senders and receivers, and to ensure the integrity of the data within it.
